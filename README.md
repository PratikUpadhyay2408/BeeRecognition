## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/bee-subspecies-classification.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd bee-subspecies-classification

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example commands for training the model
python src/train.py --dataset /path/to/training/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32

# Example commands for making predictions
python src/predict.py --model /path/to/trained/model --input /path/to/input/image.jpg

# Example commands for evaluating the model
python src/evaluate.py --model /path/to/trained/model --test_dataset /path/to/test/dataset
```

## Data
Describe the datasets used in the project. Include details about the data format, sources, and any preprocessing steps applied to the data.

## Model
Explain the classification model architecture, including layers, activation functions, and any other relevant details. If there are multiple iterations of the model, document the improvements and changes made in each version.

## Results
Present the results of the experiments conducted using the model. Include metrics, charts, and any other visualizations that help explain the performance of the classification model.
